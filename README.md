# tl;dr 
## 1. Clone. Then with your terminal, in root directory run:
## 2. `yarn impregnate`
## 3. `yarn start`
## 4. Enjoy !

`yarn impregnate` script should take ~60s to run. Don't interrupt it: use this time to get up and go drink a glass of water. Don't forget that to stay healthy as an adult you need to drink AT LEAST 1.5L of water per day !

Once it's finished, `yarn start` will run the backend & the frontend in two separate terminals.

Also Caterpillar.
